A* Grid Path Planning Implementation

This module implements the A* path planning algorithm on a 2D grid with obstacles.
The implementation allows for diagonal movements and uses a Euclidean distance
heuristic to guide the search.

------------
1. Add your name below
2. Complete all sections marked with "Student Task:" comments/docstrings
3. The main algorithm steps are in the `planning` method
4. Test your implementation with different obstacle configurations in main()
